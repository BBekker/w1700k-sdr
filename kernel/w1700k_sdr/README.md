# w1700k_sdr

Linux driver and unit-side tools that run the W1700K's MediaTek MT7996
(PCI `14c3:7990`, primary interface) as an SDR receiver. The driver:

- loads the MCU firmware (ROM patch, then the WM, WA and optionally DSP RAM
  containers) over the WFDMA download rings;
- turns the WM event ring into a stream ring: 1536 RX descriptors cycling
  through a 1 GiB DRAM buffer of 8 KiB slices, mapped read-only by userspace;
- optionally sends every slice to the network as one UDP datagram, zero copy;
- relays small word writes/reads to the firmware's mailbox page, also while a
  stream runs.

It runs our own firmware (`firmware/`), which takes its commands in that
mailbox page; the driver sends no runtime MCU commands. Three WFDMA rings are
bound: TX 16 (firmware scatter chunks), TX 17 (download commands) and RX 0
(download replies, then the stream).

Everything is polled; the driver requests no interrupt. It disables PCIe ASPM
(L0s/L1) on the device at probe, since ASPM limits device DMA to about
0.33 GB/s and the stream needs 1.28 GB/s.

Files: `pci.c` (device, ioctls, mmap), `pump.c` (stream pump), `export.c`
(UDP export), `fwdl.c` (download executor), `fwdl_wire.c` (download command
wire format), `fwdl-image.c` (container parsing), `dma-ring.c` (rings),
`wfdma.c` (WFDMA control), `mmio.c` (BAR translation), `ownership.c`. The
clients are `probe.c`, `download.c`, `stream.c` and `ctl.c`, with
`client.h`. The ABI is `include/uapi/w1700k_sdr.h`.

## Build

```sh
# module, against a configured and built kernel tree
make -C platform/linux module KDIR=/path/to/kernel/build CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-musl-
# the four static clients
make -C platform/linux reader CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-musl-
```

Both write to `kernel/w1700k_sdr/build/`. Without arguments both use the
platform build (`platform/build/linux` and its Buildroot toolchain), as
`make sdr` at the top level does. The clients are C11, one source file each,
and must come from the same tree as the module: every client checks
`W1700K_SDR_ABI_VERSION` and the capability bits it needs and refuses to run
against a different driver (`mt7996-download --reset` excepted, so a new
client can reset an old driver before it is unloaded).

Host tests (C harnesses compiled with the host compiler, no hardware):

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_kernel_*.py'
```

## Device

`/dev/w1700k-sdr`, mode 0600. Every ioctl except `GET_INFO` needs
`CAP_SYS_RAWIO`. `read()` returns one JSON status line without touching the
device, also during a stream:

```json
{"abi":5,"driver":"w1700k_sdr","pci":"0000:01:00.0","online":true,"suspended":false,"dma_exposed":true,"streaming":false}
```

## Ioctls

| ioctl | what it does |
|---|---|
| `GET_INFO` | ABI version, capabilities, PCI identity, `max_read`, BAR0 size |
| `ACQUIRE_HOST` | band-0 host ownership (LPCR DRV_OWN, wait FW_OWN_STAT clear, ack). Needed by every device access; lost on `RESET_MT` |
| `DOWNLOAD` | one firmware container, format detected: the ROM patch (semaphore, regions, PATCH_FINISH) or a RAM container (regions, FW_START with the RAM type's working-PDA bit). The first call allocates and binds the rings, enables bus mastering and pins the module |
| `RESET_MT` | WiFi subsystem reset (`0x70028600` bit 0 pulsed, 20 ms per edge), then frees the rings and unpins the module. Refused while the stream ring is mapped or exported datagrams are queued |
| `READ_MEM` | diagnostics: up to 4096 bytes through the BAR translation, only inside the host CSR page `0x000e0000-0x000e0fff` (LPCR `0xe0010`, FW_STATE `0xe00f0`), ROM `0x00800000-0x0080ffff` or patch SRAM `0x00900000-0x0090ffff` |
| `STREAM_RX` | the stream pump, on the calling thread (below) |
| `CTL` | up to 64 word writes then 64 word reads in `0x0090b000-0x0090fffc`; performed by the pump between sweeps while a stream runs |

## Clients

All print JSON lines on stdout and exit 0 on success, 1 on failure, 2 on a
usage error. Lines marked `attempt` are flushed before the device is touched.

## Bring-up

Our firmware set (`make -C firmware`, `firmware/build/firmware.json`), as
`w1700k load` downloads it:

```sh
D=/dev/w1700k-sdr
mt7996-probe $D 0x00901000 4 --acquire           # host ownership
mt7996-download $D --reset                       # clean MCU state
mt7996-probe $D 0x00901000 4 --acquire           # ownership again after the reset
mt7996-download $D w1700k_rom_patch.bin --i-understand
mt7996-download $D w1700k_wm.bin --i-understand
mt7996-download $D w1700k_wa.bin --i-understand --wa
mt7996-probe $D 0x0090f300 4                     # word0 0x4d57574f ("OWWM"): our WM's status block
```

Our WM is then driven through its mailbox page with `mt7996-ctl`
(`host/w1700k/wm.py`, `firmware/wm/wm.h`). Before `rmmod`, run
`mt7996-download $D --reset`: the module stays pinned while the device can
reach the rings.

## Streaming

`STREAM_RX` with `timeout_ms` 0 returns the geometry. Map the device with
`PROT_READ`, `MAP_SHARED`, offset 0 and length
`header_bytes + slices * slice_bytes`:

```
struct w1700k_sdr_stream_ring   (header_bytes, page aligned)
  u64 completed                 completions so far (load-acquire)
  u32 slots, slices, slice_bytes, header_bytes, reserved[10]
  u32 ctrl[slices]              per slice: descriptor ctrl, length in [29:16]
slice 0 .. slices-1             slice_bytes each
```

Completion `c` is in slice `c % slices`. A reader more than `slices - slots`
completions behind `completed` has been overwritten. Command replies also
pass through this ring, so completion numbers do not start at 0.

A stream: the host posts the STREAM radio command to our WM through `CTL`
(`host/w1700k/stream.py`); the WM arms the capture and enters its producer,
which waits for the go word. Then, as `stream.py` runs it:

```sh
mt7996-stream $D --seconds 604800 --idle-ms 300 \
    --go 0x0090f008 0x474f474f --stop 0x0090f008 0x504f5453 --threads 0 \
    --export eth1 10.77.0.1 10.77.0.10 aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff 7700 --ports 8 \
    --drain-ms 3000 --export-cpu 2 --cpu 3
mt7996-ctl $D --read 0x0090f000 64                     # the producer's result page, afterwards
```

The driver, already holding the device, writes the go word. The stream ends
at `--seconds`, on SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP,
after `--idle-ms` without data, on device removal or on a ring error. In every
case the driver then writes the stop word and keeps re-arming the ring until
`max(idle_ms, 300 ms)` pass without a completion (at most 5 s), so the
producer can drain its own TX ring. `kill -USR1` takes a `--snap` snapshot.

### Export datagrams

One per completed slice, from `src_port + n % ports` to `dst_port`, IPv4 with
DF, UDP checksum filled by the MAC:

| bytes | content |
|---|---|
| 14 | Ethernet: `dst_mac`, the interface's address, `0x0800` |
| 20 | IPv4 |
| 8 | UDP |
| 16 | `struct w1700k_sdr_export_header`: `le32 magic 0x31524453` ("SDR1"), `le16 offset` (0), `le16 slice_bytes` (this completion's length), `le64 seq` (completion number) |
| n | the slice's bytes |

The interface needs scatter-gather and an MTU of at least `slice_bytes + 44`
(8236 for 8 KiB slices). The device's TX queue is the only flow control; the
export reports `-ENOBUFS` if it falls more than `slices - slots - 64`
completions behind.

## Hazards

- The first `DOWNLOAD`/`STREAM_RX` after loading allocates 1 GiB as
  131072 order-1 pages (no CMA): load the module early, before memory
  fragments.
- The rings stay allocated and the module pinned until `RESET_MT`. Removing
  the device resets the WiFi subsystem before unmapping; if a mapping or a
  queued datagram still exists then, the module stays pinned.
- A download command whose TX descriptor is never reaped makes every later
  `DOWNLOAD` and `STREAM_RX` fail with `EBUSY` until `RESET_MT`.
- Host reads or writes inside the WiFi power island (UMAC SYSRAM, PLE/PSE,
  LMAC) can hang the SoC and wedge the MT7996 until power is removed; that is
  why `READ_MEM` and `CTL` accept only the windows above.
- A stream holds the device: other ioctls wait for it, except `GET_INFO`,
  `read()` and `CTL`.
- Lossless export needs the AN7581 QDMA congestion drop
  (`TXQ_CNGST_DROP_EN`) off; airoha_eth enables it.
