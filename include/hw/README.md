# Hardware register reference

C headers describing every register this project knows on the W1700K: the
MediaTek MT7996 radio (host interface, MCUs, capture path, PHY), its RF A-dies
(MT7976, MT7977) and the Airoha AN7581 SoC. They are written as a datasheet:
registers the production code never touches are documented too.

The headers are plain C with no kernel or libc dependencies, so the Linux
driver, the bare-metal RISC-V firmware and host tools can all include them.

## Conventions

- **Address spaces.** The MT7996 is reached through several views of the same
  buses. Each header states which view its addresses are in: a host PCIe BAR0
  offset, a connectivity bus address (`0x7xxxxxxx`), a WF bus address
  (`0x8xxxxxxx`), an MCU bus address as the WM, WA or DSP sees it, or a 12-bit
  A-die register index reached over the A-die SPI. AN7581 addresses are
  physical.
- **Names.** `<CHIP>_<BLOCK>_<REG>` for an address, `<REG>_<FIELD>` for a field
  mask, `<REG>_<FIELD>_<NAME>` for an enumerated value. Per-instance, per-band
  or per-chain registers are function-like macros. A register of unknown role
  gets an offset name (`ADIE_CHAIN_E90`, `MT7996_PHY_CSD_104(band, chain)`).
  Every name is defined once, in the header of its block;
  [`tools/check_hw_names.py`](../../tools/check_hw_names.py) reports any name
  defined twice.
- **Generated table headers** (marked in the index) hold MediaTek's tables as
  X-macro lists of (register name, value), with the constants that select and
  walk them; they include the headers that name their registers.
- **Fields** use `HW_BIT()` and `HW_GENMASK()` from [`hw_bits.h`](hw_bits.h);
  `HW_GET()` and `HW_PREP()` extract and insert field values.
- **Confidence.** Each register or field carries one tag:
  - `[measured]`: verified on hardware;
  - `[static]`: read from firmware, ROM or driver code;
  - `[inferred]`: reasoned from other facts, not yet verified.
- **`HAZARD:`** marks accesses that hang the MCU or the host, wedge a bus, need a
  reload or a power cycle, burn an eFuse, or transmit. Read these before poking
  a register by hand.
